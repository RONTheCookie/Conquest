Conquest
======

## Harness the powers of magic to destroy the enemy core before they destroy yours!

### **Conquest** is a mini-game where two teams fight to the death over an objective.

**Cores**:
Each core must be broken 20 times to win the game. Cores can only be broken in the core breaking stage, and will be broken two times quicker in the blitz stage. The core is an individual emerald block which will always respawn once broken, unless it loses all of its life.

**Classes**:
There are many different classes to choose from in Conquest. Each class has their own unique ability which can be cast when the cooldown is off! Use your class on offensively to rush the core, or defensively to defend your own. 

**Maps**:
The maps in Conquest have two sides: Red and Blue. Each side has 2 iron mines, a gold mine, and a lapis mine. Every map also has a fully-maxed enchanting table. A mob spawner, with spiders, skeletons, and zombies is hidden underground in every map. The core of each map is located at the very corner of each team's island.

**Game Physics**: 
When breaking ores, they will automatically be turned to an ingot and placed directly in your inventory. The ore will then respawn based on a timer; example, iron ore will respawn in 60 seconds, gold 120, etc. The game is also organized into different stages, which all last at least 10 minutes in length. The stages start with time to get geared and make a defense, then being able to break the core, followed by diamonds spawning at middle along with a boss battle, finished by a blitz-breaking core mode.
